# Rock Wall Climbing Gym Website

This project is based on a previous project that I have [done](https://github.com/MarcMartinez25/Sass-Crash-Course).

When the project is finished it will be a landing page for an imaginary rock climbing gym. This project demontstrates my ability to use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp). 

#### Here is a demo of what the finished project will look like:
This was created in Adobe inDesign
